So far, our `plot()` function has been fairly simple; map an input coordinate
to a specific pixel, and color in that pixel.
This works well for simple function systems (like Sierpinski's Gasket),
but more complex systems (like our reference parameters) produce grainy images.

Every time we "turn on" pixels that have already been enabled, we're wasting work.
Can we do something more intelligent with that information?

## Image histograms

To start with, it's worth demonstrating how much work is actually "wasted."
We'll render the reference image again, but this time, counting the times
we tried to turn on a pixel.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import plotHistogramSource from "!!raw-loader!./plotHistogram";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{plotHistogramSource}</CodeBlock>

import Canvas from "../src/Canvas";
import FlameHistogram from "./FlameHistogram";

<Canvas width={400} height={400} hidden={true}>
    <FlameHistogram/>
</Canvas>
